            <p style="font-weight: bold;">About Us</p>
We are a small team of enthusiasts who wish to build a vibrant social group of people with shared love and interest in reading. We support free access to knowledge and want to make a contribution in flattening the existing lopsided holding and access pattern to the most valued knowledge resource, the Books. Through Bookmates we propose to energize the movement of books across the network of readers and create an ecosystem where each transaction of the book adds value for all...the Lender, the Borrower, and the Book. 

            <p style="font-weight: bold;">  BookMates Vision <br></p> 
                A lot is invested in a book before it comes up for sale at a bookstore. Years of writers' hard work, sacrifice of a tree to make its paper, publishing effort and transportation challenges are few important ones. At that, once a person purchases and finishes reading this masterpiece, it spends the rest of its ‘readworthy’ lifetime parked on a bookshelf, lying idle. We believe this is an inefficient method of exploiting such a rich resource. Through Bookmates we propose to help readers overcome ‘Bookinertia’ by sharing their idle books on a vibrant social network of enthusiastic readers. In doing so, we aspire to create an ecosystem where each transaction of book will add value for all...the Lender, the Borrower and the Book. <br> <br>
            
            <p style="font-weight: bold;">  What is BookMates <br></p> 
        BookMates is a voluntary movement of book lovers who wish to share their storybooks with other enthusiastic readers and knowledge seekers. The project aims at collaborating by connecting those with a collection of books to those who seek them. While the portal appears to represent an online digital library model, its scope is way beyond mere lending and borrowing of books. BookMates is a thriving ecosystem where both, reader and book evolve simultaneously. 

        <p style="font-weight: bold;"> Why BookMates </p>
A book's journey invariably starts from a vibrant bookstore and ends at a lonesome bookshelf, after a brief sojourn by our bedside. We seldom realize that for every book, eternally placed on our bookshelf, there are millions of underprivileged seekers who long for an opportunity to read it. Therefore, parking a book is simply bad bookonomics. We need to free our books from shelves and help them find new readers. For every book has the potential of becoming a story in itself, if we just let it do so. 

<p style="font-weight: bold;">Every Book is a Story</p>
We at BookMates believe that every book has the potential to become a story in itself. This belief is central to the idea of BookMates. To build this story, every single book offered on the portal has an exclusive webpage dedicated to it. In addition to normal details, it has an exclusive ‘MyBookStory’ place earmarked to record the journey of the book. The Lender member starts the journey of her book by penning down a short note of her thoughts and impressions about the book, including when and where she bought or got the book. Once the MyBookStory space is filled up by the Lender member, the book is considered ready to move off the shelf to start its journey. <br> <br>

Borrower members are thereafter required to read the book and add their brief experiences specific to the book in the same MyBookStory space. This way, with each exchange of hand, the book becomes richer by another reader's experience. At some stage, the original lender will have a well-traveled book that will not only tell the story written by the author but will also have a story of its own journey. The portal will offer the option of printing these memoirs for physically attaching it with the book at the end of its journey. 

As we intend to build a responsible community of knowledge seekers, there is no time stipulation or penalties involved with loaning a book on BookMates. As willing participants in the initiative, we will find innovative ways to encourage members to move the books forward and not let them be parked on their bookshelves or bedsides for too long. 

<p style="font-weight: bold;">And Then We are Even More</p>
BookMates is also a platform for sharing ideas and building friendships based on common and shared interest for reading. Subsequent builds of the portal will offer a microblogging facility to its members for expressing their literary talent in the form of their own original writings or suggested alternate plots and endings to existing books. 

<p style="font-weight: bold;">How to become a BookMate</p>
Everyone with a passion for reading is welcome to join the BookMates community as a member by registering on this portal. Members owning books are encouraged to offer their personal collections for sharing through the portal, which are then available to other members to borrow. Individuals with no book to contribute are also equally welcome to join as a member. 

<p style="font-weight: bold;">What is Expected of you as a BookMate </p>
Lender Member:- Lender is a member who offers her book to other members for reading. The Lender member starts the journey of her book by penning down a short note of her thoughts and impressions about the book, including when and where she bought or got the book. Once the Bookstory sheet is filled up by the Lender member, the book is considered ready to move off the shelf to start its journey. We believe that while borrowers will be benefited by the free access to the rich resource of knowledge on BookMates, Lenders will also gain by having their book evolve as a story. <br> <br>

Borrower Member:- Borrower is the member who takes up a book through the BookMates portal for reading purposes. Once the book is with the Borrower, she can take all the time needed to read it. However, she should be mindful that there are others waiting to read the same book. She also has to add her bit of story to the book on the Storysheet of the Lender member. <br> <br>


<p style="font-weight: bold;">We Plan to Grow</p>
From Here:- The project is based on a nonprofit business model. The first build of this project restricts itself to the Campus level sharing of books. Portal provides visibility and availability of books to all members who may then undertake the actual exchange in person on or off-campus. As school-going children may not have ready access to Smartphones, the initial version is being developed in the form of a Website for which the coding language used is HTML, CSS, and PHP.  <br> <br> 

To Where:- Subsequent builds will involve the development of Mobile Apps for Android and IOS environment with lending and sharing of books facilitated through physical exchange/ a sponsored and/or paid courier service. Subsequent models will also facilitate the exchange of books within a city and thereafter at the pan-India level. As bylaws preclude international exchange of books, the final version envisaged involves having country-specific chapters of BookMates. 

So come friends, let's move the Books forward…
